<p style="font-size: 25px">The day began like all the others. Get up, eat, brush teeth, then play games. But unlike all those other days, while I was playing my games I was informed that we would buy a new dog. I was hesitant to go, because just a day earlier we were going to pick up a different dog (which was a labradoodle), but while we were on our way there we were told that the dog we were going to pick up was already re-homed. With that in mind, I asked for pictures of the dog, and once I saw its white and black fur and blue eyes, I was totally on board with buying this dog. I raced out of the room to put on my shoes and ran to the car, and about 5 minutes later we were on our way to pick up the dog.</p>

<p style="font-size: 25px">We already had a name in mind for this dog, and it was "Kuta". It is the same name that would be the labradoodle's name had we picked him up in time. The estimated time to go to the area where we would pick up this dog, (Which was an Aussiedoodle), was 2 hours to and from the pick-up place. But because of Low traffic, we got there in 30 minutes. The lady that would give us the dog was super kind and let us bond a bit with the dog before we bought it. After getting to meet the dog, we took it home with a stop at a local petstore to get a collar for her. We finally made it home and we let her make her first few steps which was really cute to see. We already had a dog before this one, and her name is Mango. She is a 1 year old Maltipoo that usually barks if any dog comes into sight. But when we let Kuta into the house, She was completely silent. She was even ignoring her favorite dog treats because she was interested in checking out this new dog. She was even ignoring her owners because she was so interested in learning more about Kuta. At night, we decided to move both dogs into different rooms so that Mango could concentrate on putting her attention back on her owner. Fortunately, This worked and Mango is no longer bothered about Kuta.</p>
